In supervised learning, the training data is labelled.
Typical supervised learning tasks include classification and predicting a target numeric value.
Some of the most important supervised learning algorithms include
 k-nearest neighbors linear regression logistical regression support vector machines decision trees and random forests neural networks  In unsupervised learning, the training data is unlabelled.</description>
